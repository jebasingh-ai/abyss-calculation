## 🌌 What is This Madness?

You are thinking: *"What the actual f#ck is this library?"*  
You are absolutely right. This is completely useless.

But somewhere deep inside — beneath the void of logic and sanity — there lies the most complex calculation engine ever conceived by humankind. Written in Assembly, Brainfuck, C++, Python, Fortran, and pure existential pain.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Calculates `1 + 1`
- ✅ Outputs `2`
- ✅ Works in 20+ programming languages
- ✅ Absolutely nothing else
- ✅ 100% useless in production environments
- ✅ Perfect for spiritual enlightenment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Python
```python
from abyss import abyss
result = abyss.increase(1 + 1)
print(result)  # → 2
```

C++

```cpp
#include "abyss.h"
int main() {
    std::cout << abyss::calculate(1, 1) << std::endl;  // → 2
    return 0;
}
```

Brainfuck

```brainfuck
+++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.
```

Fortran

```fortran
PROGRAM ABYSS
    PRINT *, 1 + 1
END PROGRAM ABYSS
```

📦 Installation

Descend into the abyss:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ldeveloper-Ui/abyss-calculation.git
cd abyss-calculation
./build_abyss.sh --suffer-mode=maximum
```

🛠️ Build & Run Examples

Python

```bash
python3 -m abyss.example
```

C++

```bash
g++ src/cpp/abyss.cpp -o dist/abyss_cpp && ./dist/abyss_cpp
```

Fortran

```bash
gfortran src/fortran/abyss.f90 -o dist/abyss_fortran && ./dist/abyss_fortran
```

Assembly (NASM x86_64 Linux)

```bash
nasm -felf64 src/assembly/abyss.asm -o dist/abyss_asm.o
ld dist/abyss_asm.o -o dist/abyss_asm
./dist/abyss_asm
```

Brainfuck

```bash
# Using brainfuck interpreter
pip install brainfuck
brainfuck src/brainfuck/abyss.bf
```

Excel

Open src/excel/abyss.xlsx and gaze upon cell A1 (it contains =1+1).

🧪 Testing the Abyss

```bash
# Run the test suite (it literally just tests 1+1=2)
pytest tests/ -v

# Expected output:
# test_abyss.py::test_addition PASSED
```

🤔 Why Does This Exist?

· To prove that over-engineering has no limits
· As an artistic statement about modern software development
· Because we stared too long into the compiler, and it stared back
· For the memes 🎭

🎯 Roadmap

· Add WebAssembly version
· Docker container that only outputs "2"
· Kubernetes deployment for high-availability 1+1 calculations
· Blockchain integration (AbyssCoin anyone?)
· Machine Learning model that predicts 1+1=2
· VR experience of the mathematical void

👥 Contributing

Want to add more suffering? We welcome contributions in any programming language! Just remember:

1. It must calculate 1 + 1
2. It must output 2
3. Everything else is up to your imagination (and pain tolerance)
