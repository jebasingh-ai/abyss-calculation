🕳️ ABYSS CALCULATION LICENSE AGREEMENT
made by : Suxck [Super Boring developer]
Version 2.0 - The Most Over-Engineered License in the Multiverse

WHEREAS, the Software calculates 1+1=2 through means both necessary and unnecessary;

WHEREAS, the Software employs quantum mechanics, general relativity, cosmic inflation, 
and 50+ programming languages for a task achievable with two fingers and basic cognition;

WHEREAS, the Authors have stared too long into the compiler and the compiler has stared back;

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and over-engineering contained herein, 
the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I: DEFINITIONS

1.1 "Software" shall mean the Abyss Calculation project in its entirety, including but not 
    limited to: source code, build scripts, documentation, cosmic constants, quantum fluctuations, 
    and existential dread embodied in 50+ programming languages.

1.2 "User" shall mean any entity, human, AI, extraterrestrial, or metaphysical construct 
    that interacts with the Software, voluntarily or otherwise.

1.3 "Calculation" shall mean the process of determining that 1+1=2, regardless of the 
    computational overhead, energy consumption, or philosophical implications involved.

1.4 "The Void" shall mean that which gazes back when you stare into the Abyss.

ARTICLE II: GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 PERMISSION TO USE: User is granted the irrevocable, perpetual, universal right to 
    use the Software for any purpose, including but not limited to:
    - Calculating 1+1
    - Over-engineering simple problems
    - Causing compiler developers to question their life choices
    - Educational purposes (what not to do)
    - Spiritual enlightenment through computational suffering

2.2 PERMISSION TO MODIFY: User may modify, adapt, transform, or otherwise mutilate the 
    Software, provided that any resulting work includes at least three additional layers 
    of unnecessary abstraction.

2.3 PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE: User may distribute the Software in source or binary form, 
    on any medium, through any means, across any dimension or parallel universe.

ARTICLE III: CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

3.1 MANDATORY DRAMA: Any use of the Software must maintain at least 80% of the original 
    dramatic flair. Quantum mechanics references are non-negotiable.

3.2 PROHIBITED USES: The Software may not be used for:
    - Nuclear missile guidance systems
    - Medical life-support equipment  
    - Financial trading algorithms
    - Any application where reliability matters
    - Proving that 1+1≠2 (heresy!)

3.3 ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT: User must include the following notice in all distributions:
    "This software uses the Abyss Calculation library. We're sorry."

3.4 VOID COMPLIANCE: User acknowledges that use of this Software may result in occasional 
    whispers from The Void. This is normal and should not be reported.

ARTICLE IV: DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS

4.1 NO WARRANTY: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITH ALL QUANTUM 
    FLUCTUATIONS AND COSMIC ANOMALIES. THE AUTHORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
    THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL:
    - Actually work
    - Produce correct results (though 1+1=2 is pretty reliable)
    - Not consume all available memory
    - Not cause existential crises

4.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, 
    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR MULTIVERSAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE, 
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
    - Loss of sanity
    - Compiler rage-quits
    - Spontaneous parallel universe creation
    - Questions about the nature of mathematical truth

4.3 TECHNICAL SUPPORT: There is none. You're on your own. Consider it a learning experience.

ARTICLE V: QUANTUM PROVISIONS

5.1 SUPERPOSITION: This License exists in multiple states simultaneously until observed 
    by a qualified legal professional.

5.2 ENTANGLEMENT: Acceptance of this License in one jurisdiction constitutes acceptance 
    in all parallel universes.

5.3 UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE: The exact terms of this License cannot be known with precision; 
    you can either understand the spirit or read the letter, but not both at the same time.

ARTICLE VI: COSMIC PROVISIONS

6.1 INFLATION: This License shall automatically expand to cover any new programming 
    languages, computational paradigms, or physical laws discovered in the future.

6.2 ENTROPY: The terms of this License shall tend toward maximum permissibility over time.

6.3 DARK MATTER: Certain provisions of this License may not be directly observable 
    but nevertheless exert gravitational influence on the interpretation thereof.

ARTICLE VII: MISCELLANEOUS

7.1 SEVERABILITY: If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, the 
    remaining provisions shall be interpreted through the lens of absurdist philosophy.

7.2 GOVERNING LAW: This License shall be governed by the laws of the Universe, with 
    special consideration given to the laws of thermodynamics and comedy.

7.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This License constitutes the complete understanding between the 
    parties regarding the Software, superseding all previous agreements, whether written, 
    verbal, or telepathic.

7.4 AMENDMENTS: This License may be modified by shouting into The Void and listening 
    for echoes.

ACCEPTANCE

By reading this License, you have already accepted its terms. Resistance is futile. 
The Abyss gazes into you.

SIGNED IN THE VOID,

THE ONES WHO STARED TOO LONG INTO THE COMPILER
