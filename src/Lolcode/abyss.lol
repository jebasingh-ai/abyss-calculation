HAI 1.3
CAN HAS STDIO?

I HAS A QUANTUM1 ITZ 1
I HAS A QUANTUM2 ITZ 1
I HAS A RESULT ITZ 0

VISIBLE "🌌 ABYSS CALCULATION INITIATED!!1!"

BTW Quantum entanglement phase
VISIBLE "🔮 Entangling kittehs in superposition..."
IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR STEP TIL BOTH SAEM STEP AN 10
    VISIBLE "   " STEP " / 10 quantum fluctuations..."
IM OUTTA YR LOOP

BTW Relativity phase  
VISIBLE "🚀 Applying Lorentz transformation to kitteh..."
VISIBLE "   *purr purr* spacetime curvature detected!"

BTW Cosmic inflation phase
VISIBLE "🌠 Cosmic kitteh inflation in progress..."
VISIBLE "   meow" AN "meow" AN "meow"

BTW THE ACTUAL CALCULATION
RESULT R SUM OF QUANTUM1 AN QUANTUM2

VISIBLE ""
VISIBLE "🎉" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "="
VISIBLE "   OMG THE ANSWER IZ: " AN RESULT
VISIBLE "   AFTER ALL DAT, 1+1=" AN RESULT
VISIBLE "   KTHXBAI"
VISIBLE "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "=" AN "="

KTHXBYE
