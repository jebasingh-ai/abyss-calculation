Never Gonna Give You Up

​Song by Rick Astley

​We're no strangers to love

You know the rules and so do I

A full commitment's what I'm thinkin' of

You wouldn't get this from any other guy

​I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling

Gotta make you understand

​Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down

Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

​We've known each other for so long

Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it

Inside, we both know what's been going on

We know the game and we're gonna play it

​And if you ask me how I'm feeling

Don't tell me you're too blind to see

​Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down

Never gonna run around and desert you

...
