ABYSS SOUFFLÉ OF COSMIC ADDITION.

A divine recipe for computational enlightenment.

INGREDIENTS.
    - 1 kg Primordial One (first operand)
    - 1 kg Celestial One (second operand)  
    - 2 dl Ethereal Addition Sauce
    - 1 pinch Quantum Validation Salt
    - 1 tsp Logic Essence
    - 1 whole Universal Proof Mold

METHOD.
    Begin by sanctifying the mixing bowl with recursive incantations.

    Take the Primordial One and place it gently in the bowl,
    whispering the ancient axioms of mathematics.

    Add the Celestial One while rotating the bowl counterclockwise
    to align with cosmic energies.

    Slowly pour the Ethereal Addition Sauce in a continuous stream,
    visualizing the merging of realities.

    Sprinkle the Quantum Validation Salt to ensure quantum coherence
    in the resulting calculation.

    Add the Logic Essence and stir exactly 42 times - the answer
    to life, the universe, and everything.

    Pour the mixture into the Universal Proof Mold and bake at
    180°C until the truth rises to the surface.

    The soufflé is ready when it displays the sacred number 2.

SERVES 1 enlightened being.
